## 6 reasons why GPT-3 is shockingly amazing!

OpenAI has very recently described <ins  class='sub-ins-2'>GPT-3</ins>, new generative language model that is bigger than GPT-2 by orders of magnitude and - a deep-learning model for NLP with over <ins  class='sub-ins-2'>175</ins> billion parameters. The model is pre-trained on nearly half a <ins  class='sub-ins-2'>trillion</ins> words and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several NLP benchmarks without fine-tuning.

In paper published on <ins  class='sub-ins-2'>arXiv</ins>, a team of over 30 co-authors described the model and several experiments. The researchers' goal was to produce an NLP system that performs well on a variety of tasks with little or no <ins  class='sub-ins-2'>fine-tuning</ins>, and previous work had indicated that larger models might be the solution.

To test that hypothesis, the team increased the model size from <ins  class='sub-ins-2'>1.5 billion</ins> parameters in GPT2 to <ins  class='sub-ins-2'>175 billion</ins>. The datasets were collected from Common Crawl and the English-language Wikipedia.

GPT-3 has been a massive buzz recently and to testify what this buzz is all about we are going to look at 10 really interestingly shocking ways GPT-3 can revolutionise AI in no time.

## 1. Mock-up Websites

Developer <ins  class='sub-ins'>Jordan Singer</ins> used GPT-3 × Figma plugin that recieves a URL and a description of a website. Something as simple as typing in plain English, ‘an apple.com like website for Twitter’, would result in the following:

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="100%" poster="assets/1-poster.png">
    <source src="assets/videos/1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="assets/videos/1.mp4" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="assets/videos/1.mp4" type="video/webm">
  </video>
</figure>

## 2. ML Code

<ins  class='sub-ins'>Matt Schumer</ins>, CEO of OthersideAI, has used GPT-3 to generate code for a machine learning model, just by describing the dataset and required output.

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="100%" poster="assets/2-poster.png">
    <source src="assets/videos/2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="assets/videos/2.mp4" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="assets/videos/2.mp4" type="video/webm">
  </video>
</figure>

## 3. Layout Generator

<ins  class='sub-ins'>Sharif Shameem</ins> has leveraged GPT-3 to generate code. All he had to do was write a couple of samples to give some context to GPT-3.

Shareen tweeted that If he wanted to write output plain HTML/CSS instead of JSX, all he would have to do would be to rewrite the two initial samples in HTML/CSS. Then all of GPT-3’s outputs would be in plain HTML/CSS.

## 4. JavaScript API

<ins  class='sub-ins'>Antonio Gomez</ins>, a senior engineer at Apple, used GPT-3 to produce generative code snippets of the JavaScript API by textually describing the elements and their parameters needed to create a WebGL 3D scene.

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="100%" poster="assets/4.png">
    <source src="assets/videos/4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="assets/videos/4.mp4" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="assets/videos/4.mp4" type="video/webm">
  </video>
</figure>

## 5. Search Engines

<ins  class='sub-ins'>Paras Chopra</ins>, the founder of Wingify, used GPT-3 to create a search engine ‘Ask me anything’, that functions smoothly as shown in the demo above.

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="100%" poster="assets/5.png">
    <source src="assets/videos/5.mp4" type="video/mp4">

## 6. Understand Code

<ins  class='sub-ins'>Amjad Masad</ins>, CEO of Replit, built an application where one can type queries about the code on the go and learn information about the functionality of each item in the code.

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="100%" poster="assets/6.png">
    <source src="assets/videos/6.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="assets/videos/6.mp4" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="assets/videos/6.mp4" type="video/webm">
  </video>
