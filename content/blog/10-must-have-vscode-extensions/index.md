Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It is one of the most widely used code editors among professional programmers. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

**Let us take a look at the top 10 VSCode extensions (Rated by absolutely me - because I use them):**

###**1. <u>Preetier</u>**
